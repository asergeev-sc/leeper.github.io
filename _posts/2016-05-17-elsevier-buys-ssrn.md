I have a post out today on the [LSE Impact Blog](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2016/05/18/elsevier-purchase-ssrn-social-scientists-face-questions-over-whether-centralised-repository-is-in-their-interests/) about Elsevier's purchase of Social Science Electronic Publishing, Inc., the publisher of the social science preprint service SSRN. I have [previously written with some skepticism](http://thomasleeper.com/2014/06/comment-on-open-science/) about the involvement of for-profit organizations in the work of open science. My post on the Impact Blog takes a somewhat more ambivalent perspective but I would not currently say I am optimistic about the future of SSRN. That said, I hope this acquisition creates an opportunity for a robust social science analogue to arXiv. Fingers crossed at this point.
