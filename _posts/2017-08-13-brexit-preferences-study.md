A summary of my recent research with Sara Hobolt (LSE) and James Tilley (Oxford) on the public's preferences over Brexit negotiations, which uses a conjoint experimental design, has been posted on the [LSE Brexit Blog](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/brexit/2017/08/13/the-british-are-indifferent-about-many-aspects-of-brexit-but-leave-and-remain-voters-are-divided-on-several-key-issues/).

A [detailed technical report on the design and findings](https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/tjl-sharing/assets/Brexit_Means_Brexit_Technical_Report.pdf) is also available.
