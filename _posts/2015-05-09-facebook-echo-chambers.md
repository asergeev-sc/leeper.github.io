Today, I published a post responding to criticisms of [a recent *Science* article](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/early/2015/05/08/science.aaa1160.full)  by the Facebok data science team about echo chambers on Facebook. You can find the post on [the WPSA's *The New West* blog](https://thewpsa.wordpress.com/2015/05/09/what-can-we-learn-from-10-1-million-facebook-users-its-complicated/).
