I am an Assistant Professor in Political Behaviour in the [Department of Government](http://www.lse.ac.uk/government/home.aspx) at [the London School of Economics and Political Science](http://www.lse.ac.uk/home.aspx). I teach research methodology on the department's various [BSc programmes](http://www.lse.ac.uk/government/degreeProgrammes/programmes/undergraduate/Home.aspx) and political psychology for the [MSc programmes in Political Science & Political Economy and Comparative Politics](http://www.lse.ac.uk/government/degreeProgrammes/programmes/masters/Home.aspx). I also coordinate the interdisciplinary [Political Behaviour Seminar series](http://www.lse.ac.uk/government/research/resgroups/PoliticalBehaviour/Political-Behaviour.aspx) and serve on the school's  [Research Ethics Committee](http://www.lse.ac.uk/intranet/researchAndDevelopment/researchDivision/policyAndEthics/ethicsGuidanceAndForms.aspx).

My research on individuals' public opinions primarily focuses on the role of information in politics. I am particularly interested in how mass attitudes reflect an interaction between the broader information environment - including the mass media and political elites - and individual-level attributes - namely citizens' expressed behaviors, psychological traits, social identities, motivation, and opinions. Using both survey and experimental methods, I attempt to study public opinion and political behavior from the perspectives of social and cognitive psychology, mass communication, and democratic theory. Additionally, I am currently engaged in ongoing methodological projects related to nonrandom treatment assignment, internet-based research, survey experimental methodology, and sample-related validity concerns. I have taught numerous methodological short courses on survey and experimental methods, including at Pompeu Fabra University and the European University Institute.

Beyond my political science research, I also develop an array of software for the [R programming language and environment](https://cloud.r-project.org/) and participate in the [rOpenSci](http://ropensci.org/), [rOpenGov](http://ropengov.github.io/), [rOpenHealth](https://github.com/rOpenHealth), and [cloudyr](http://cloudyr.github.io) development projects. Much of my software development has been informed by my extensive experience teaching research methodology to undergraduate and postgraduate students. You can find all of my software work [on GitHub](https://github.com/leeper).

Prior to joining LSE, I was a Postdoc in the [Institut for Statskundskab](http://ps.au.dk/en/) (Department of Political Science) at [Aarhus University](http://www.au.dk/en/) in Aarhus, Denmark. At Aarhus, I was part of the [POLIS Political Parties and Issue Strategies research group](http://ps.au.dk/en/research/research-centres-and-units/polis/), where I studied interactions between political parties and public opinion. I received my MA and PhD from the [Department of Political Science](http://www.polisci.northwestern.edu/) at Northwestern University, where I was a graduate fellow at the [Institute for Policy Research](http://www.northwestern.edu/ipr/) and served as founding coordinator of the [Northwestern Political Science Research Lab (PSRL)](http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/~jnd260/lab.html). My PhD dissertation focused on incorporating information choice and over-time dynamics into the study of political communication and opinion formation. A native of Minnesota, I previously studied at the University of Minnesota &#8211; Twin Cities with a BA *magna cum laude* in Political Science and Global Studies (with an emphasis on European politics and society).
