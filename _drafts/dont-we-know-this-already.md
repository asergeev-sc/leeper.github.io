Reviewer 2 frequently asks, don't we know this already? To an author, this is deeply frustrating feedback. Why am I writing about it if we already know it? Why the endless demand for novelty? Why is Reviewer 2 so annoying? Perhaps Reviewer 2 should see more value in this. Perhaps Reviewer 2 doesn't even understand science.

The problem with these critiques is that we are all Reviewer 2. We all are prone react to seemingly familiar research by criticizing it on grounds of novelty. If we have a strong feeling that we already know something, it can be frustrating to witness someone else's ignorance or to think that another scientist is trying to claim credit for something that others have already worked hard to demonstrate. Why is this researcher missing what is plainly obvious in "the literature"? Why are they ignoring good work or pretending that work doesn't exist? In my own experience, these feelings are particularly strong when researchers from outside of a field or subfield try to tackle questions or issues that have long been a staple topic (or settled topic) in another (sub)field (especially my own). The experience as author of being frustrated by criticisms of research novelty seems almost perfectly balanced by the frustration of seeing other work that lack apparent novelty.

In other words, we are hypocrites about novelty. What can we do about it?

When we hear about, read, or review research that appears to lack novelty, our reactions are visceral. These researchers are idiots. These researchers are oblivious. These researchers are credit-claiming for others' innovations. These researchers are merely replicating existing studies. These researchers have no good ideas of their own.

These reactions are probably hard to avoid. But being aware that these reactions often lead us to generate unconstructive feedback can help us to redirect our frustration toward more positive outcomes than mere dismisal of the work that lay in front of us.
