I have a post out today on the [LSE Impact Blog]() about Elsevier's purchase of Social Science Electronic Publishing, Inc., the publisher of the social science preprint service SSRN. I have [previously written with some skepticism](http://thomasleeper.com/2014/06/comment-on-open-science/) about the involvement of for-profit organizations in the work of open science. My post on the Impact Blog takes a somewhat more ambivalent perspective but I would not currently say I am optimistic about the future of SSRN. That said, I hope this acquisition creates an opportunity for a robust social science analogue to arXiv. Fingers crossed at this point.
