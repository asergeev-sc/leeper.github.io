What is the point of peer review? In light of [a seemingly endless stream of scientific retractions](http://retractionwatch.com/), reproducibility failures like [the Reinhart-Rogoff data glitch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_in_a_Time_of_Debt), [p-hacking](http://datacolada.org/), [the "Replication Crisis" [in psychology]](http://chronicle.com/article/Replication-Crisis-in/147301/), ["crappy, or just plain pointless" peer-reviewed research](http://andrewgelman.com/2014/03/06/much-time-spend-criticizing-research-thats-fraudulent-crappy-just-plain-pointless/), a suspicion that ["Most Published Research Findings Are False"](http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.0020124), and numerous cases of [misconduct](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Wakefield) or [outright](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/28/magazine/diederik-stapels-audacious-academic-fraud.html?pagewanted=all) [scientific](http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/26647/title/Grad-student-falsified-data/) [fraud](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Hauser), the role of peer review in contemporary science is in the cross-hairs. If the diffuse enterprise of science frequently (and perhaps increasingly) produces flawed knowledge (either intentionally or unintentionally), what value does the peer review process have for science today and in the future? I think peer review is vital to science: it is what allows scientists and the public as a whole to delineate the collective body of substantiated evidence from the noise of opinion, speculation, and lies.

But the process of peer review is broken. How so?

 - We implicitly rely on peer review to distinguish what is true from what is false, but this is not something peer review can reasonable be expected to achieve. 
 - We use peer review to make decisions about what is "publishable" and what is not, which leads to troubling biases in published research literatures.
 - Peer review is feasible because of the (generally) uncompensated labor of scientists, in either monetary or employment terms, for the financial benefit of academic publishers.
 - Peer review operates under the oversight of journal editors who have essentially unrestricted editorial control, which means that double-blind peer review exists to some extent in name-only. Editorial control may actually have significant advantages for the quality of scientific publishing, but it introduces a tension between the lauded notion of peer review and the objective of journal metrics (e.g., citations/impact factor, reputation, or revenue).
 - In many disciplines, an enormous body of information is published in non-peer-reviewed outlets (e.g., in book form) and treated as scientifically equivalent to information published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. At the same time, journals engaging in questionable tactics (e.g., no peer review, or "pay-for-publication" models) are categorically rejected because they do not employ peer review.
 - Peer review is conducted (in almost all disciplines) in private, shadowed in secrecy, and exclusively prior to publication, which treats publication as a definitive scientific statement that cannot be revised except through retraction or an antiquated method of subsequently published errata.


 
 
## What does it mean for something to be "peer-reviewed"? ##

Distinguish peer review of grants, peer review of published research, IRB review, review by way of subsequent scientific debate, Altmetrics, positive and negative citations, reproducible (e.g., internal reproduction of results by an editorial assistant), subsequent replication, etc.


## What goal should peer review strive to achieve? ##

When we review, is it our job as scientists to review the theory, research design, the implementation of the research, the usefulness of the dataset, the particulars of the analysis, the presentation and discussion of the analysis, or the quality of writing in the paper? In theory, it is all of these things.



Reveal truth

Information aggregation.


Uncover fraud

Detect scientific errors

Separate "good" from "bad" research

Honesty
 - Honest reporting of research design (cite protocol article
 - Honest reporting of mistakes (cite Lupia's lab notebook article)
 - Honest



## Disagreement Over How to Achieve Those Goals ##

Some, like the [The Winnower](https://thewinnower.com/) and [F1000Research](http://f1000research.com/), argue that post-publication peer review is a viable alternative to the current norm of pre-publication peer review.

Single-blind review



Pre-registration.
Originated in clinical studies where positive/significant results are systematically selected out of a stream of research studies.
The problem with pre-registration is that it must come with publication pre-acceptance, but this requires registrars to be linked to publication venues and in most cases they are not.

Outcome blind review

Bifurcated peer review: First phase improves manuscript, second phase decides publication venue/profile

Reproducibility and especailly data access/archiving 


## Moving Forward ##

ideas: http://jrs.sagepub.com/content/99/4/178

Things individual scientists can do:
 - Outcome-blind reviewing
 - Publish in open venues
 - Re-imagine your role as reviewer to be one of advisor, counselor, and editor rather than critic
 - Open scientific notebooks and fully reproducible research

Things graduate programs can do:
 - Improve education in scientific reproducibility
 - Improve education in how to peer review
 

 
Things media can do:
 - Respect the peer review process
 - Understand how the peer review process shapes what is published
 - Apply basic understanding of uncertainty to published results and shift emphasis from individual research studies to 

Things university employers (departments, chairs, deans, provosts, etc.) can do:
 - Employ modern, holistic, and evolving standards of research quality and impact
 - Give credit in hiring and promotion for peer review along with other editorial service

Things academic societies and their journals can do:
 - More published, peer reviewed research
 - Fewer or no journals. Instead, we need to large archives and useful recommendation engines.
 - Publish the names of article reviewers on specific articles
 - Adopt pre- and post-publication review procedures
 - Pre-accepted, registered experiments with peer-review beginning at time of registration
