# Asking Questions is Hard, So Why Don't We Teach It? #



[StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) is a website where individuals can ask for help with computer programming. The site is part of a large network of gamified question-and-answer websites designed to let motivated experts answer users' questions in exchange for points that don't really matter. I participate in StackOverflow, as well as sister sites related to LaTeX typesetting, statistics, academia, and open data, and I consider my efforts part of my public engagement and ad-hoc teaching. 

Something about asking questions.....

Big questions - like research - we should teach more research-oriented courses. Political Science is a scientific discipline, so graduates of our degree programs should be qualified scientists.

Small questions - it seems that a lot of people don't know how to ask for help. Even if they know that they can ask for help, they can struggle to convey the requisite information about their situation to enable readers to get the problem.


Relate this back to teaching, reviewing, being a discussant.
