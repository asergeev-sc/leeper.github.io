		<p>I am a Post-Doctoral Researcher in the <a href="http://ps.au.dk/en/">Institut for Statskundskab</a> at Aarhus University in Aarhus, Denmark. I received my MA and PhD from the <a href="http://www.polisci.northwestern.edu/">Department of Political Science</a> at Northwestern University, where I was a graduate fellow at the <a href="http://www.northwestern.edu/ipr/">Institute for Policy Research</a> and served as founding coordinator of the <a href="http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/~jnd260/lab.html">Northwestern Political Science Research Lab (PSRL)</a>. I previously received my BA from the University of Minnesota &#8211; Twin Cities with a BA <em>magna cum laude</em> in Political Science and Global Studies (with an emphasis on European politics and society).</p>
		<p>My research on individuals' public opinions primarily focuses on the role of information in politics. I am particularly interested in how mass attitudes reflect an interaction between the broader information environment - including the mass media and political elites - and individual-level attributes - namely citizens' expressed behaviors, psychological traits, prior knowledge and opinions, motivation, and affect. My dissertation focused on incorporating issues of information choice and over-time opinion dynamics into the study of political communication and opinion formation. At Aarhus, I am part of the <a href="http://ps.au.dk/en/research/research-centres-and-units/polis/">POLIS Political Parties and Issue Strategies research group</a>, where I study interactions between political parties and public opinion.</p>
		<p>Using both survey and experimental methods, I attempt to study public opinion and political behavior from the perspectives of social and cognitive psychology, mass communication, and democratic theory. In addition to my substantive research interests, I am currently engaged in ongoing methodological projects related to nonrandom treatment assignment, internet-based experimentation, sample-related validity concerns, and interaction effects in observational studies. I also actively develop an array of software for the R programming environment.</p>
		<p>I also occasionally comment, for a popular audience, on topics in public opinion and psychology through my <em>Psychology Today</em> blog &#8220;<a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/polarized">Polarized</a>&#8221;.</p>
