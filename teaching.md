### Teaching Philosophy ###

Political psychologists study people. We want to know how people think, act, and understand the social and political universe. It is this curiosity about human understanding of politics that fundamentally drives my experience as an educator. Just as great teachers cultivated my interests in politics, I see it as my responsibility to mentor others in developing an understanding for themselves of political questions and the happenings of politics. My research typically explores how people think and feel about politics and often grapples with meta-scientific questions about how researchers might come to know individuals' political cognitions, the causes of those beliefs and attitudes, and the implications thereof for politics more broadly. Teaching is a natural transition from this exploration of human psychology and behavior in which the objective is not for me to transmit information and formulate students' understanding but to guide them as they seek answers to their own political questions.

*Selected Student Comments:*

* Thomas was the best TA I have ever had. No other TA has ever been so helpful, accessible, or responsive. He replied to emails quickly and with very long, detailed responses. He always extended office hours around exam/paper time. He was actually just the best TA ever. He also made discussions really interesting since he would implement activities or turn the material into an interesting conversation apart from just summarizing readings or lectures.
* Thomas is great! He's very willing to help answer our questions and quite funny. Thomas is laid back and helped us see how to apply Methods to the real world.
* Thomas is the PERFECT TA. Thomas likes and really, really understands PS methods. He is super prepared for section, makes jokes, brings in activities for us to do that relate to lectures, and grades with understanding. He is also just a really nice guy - you can talk to him about your papers and get help with questions, but you can also enjoy a good conversation with him in office hours. He cares about his students and teaches them a lot. It was a pleasure.
<!--* Really nice, knowledgeable, and helpful-->
* Thomas was great; he expanded on lectures to make sure that we all understood what was taking place in class. Our section discussions were lively and very helpful to me.
* thomas is awesome - 1 of the best TAs
* The TA was fantastic. Knew his stuff. Challenged students. Facilitated discussion. Fantastic
* Thomas is one of the most patient, helpful, and knowledgeable TAs I've had, and he was extremely helpful during all of the class assignments--as someone who struggled with the coding and stats in this class, Thomas did a great job trying to break it down for me and explain concepts in multiple ways--analogies, explanations, alternate questions, etc. Awesome TA! He also really connects well with his students; he knew my name by the second week and emphasized personal growth and learning over the quarter, which is extremely important in classes like this where the material is very dense and easier to grasp for students with stronger math backgrounds--not always common in poli sci students. Thomas also always answered frantic emails about the labs (which was extremely helpful) and make himself very available to meet with students even outside his office hours. A++++ in my book
<!--* Thomas is very knowledgeable and easy to approach with questions regarding course content. His supplementary emails with R code and other documents prove that he really wants students to understand the course and not view R as something impossible to learn. He is also always available via appointment or email which is always appreciated.-->
* Thomas is great. Very knowledgable, helped make me care about what I was learning in class, and made me feel that while it was difficult, it may be useful later. Would be happy to have him as a TA again
