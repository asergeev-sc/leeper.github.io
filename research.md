## Information Choices ##

Choices define humans' day-to-day experiences. While we are acted upon by outside forces and agents, we also make choices among alternatives. In politics and political behavior, choices are abundant: what candidate do you choose to vote for, what news do you choose to read, what people do you choose to interact with, etc. In this area, I am examining both causes and effects of information choices to understand how people decide amongst alternatives and how those choices impact their later cognition and behavior.

## Public Opinion Dynamics ##

While public opinion research has been a staple element of social science inquiry for eighty years, there has been surprisingly little attention to the over-time dynamics of opinion. Instead cross-sectional surveys and one-off experiments constitute the bulk of published studies of opinions. But how to opinions change over time? What individual and contextual factors explain the dynamics of individuals' opinions over time? In this area, I am examining psychological dispositions - especially attitude strength and cognitive style - that shape attitude dynamics as well as considering how survey research practices shape our ability to measure opinions and opinion dynamics.

## Effects of Political Communication ##

Most of the information that people can and do receive about politics comes from elites - political candidates, parties, interest groups, and the mass media. Understanding the effects of political communications is therefore vital to making sense of public opinions. My work in this area examines the effectiveness of political communications in moving public preferences and also considers how different groups succeed or fail at influencing those preferences given their access to the mass public and the alternative messages being communicated in the political environment.

I have several ongoing projects in this area related to the effects of political framing over the course of a real-world campaign and the impact of interest group sources on framing effects. Some other selected publications in this area include:

* Thomas J. Leeper, and Rune Slothuus. 2014. &ldquo;Political Reasoning and Elite Partisan Competition.&rdquo; *Advances in Political Psychology*: In press.

## Experimental Methods ##

Experimental methods are an increasingly important method for understanding political and social processes and behavior. My work in this area aims to improve the quality of experimental methods and reduce barriers to entry for experimental research online. I am also completing a large project comparing the effects of convenience samples on inferences about experimental effects in a project funded by the National Science Foundation.

* Thomas J. Leeper. 2011. &ldquo;The Role of Protocol in the Design and Reporting of Experiments.&rdquo; *The Experimental Political Scientist* 2(1): 6&ndash;10.
	

## Matching Methods ##

While experimental methods are considered the *gold standard* for causal inference, many political and social phenomena cannot be readily examined with experimentation and, regardless of feasibility, much of the social and political data available to researchers is observational. One potential solution to these constraints is the approximation of experimental treatment assignment through matching techniques. In some cases, (random) experimental assignment to treatment status may even be uninformative about real-world processes involving nonrandom assignment to treatment status.

In this area I am currently examining critiques of matching methods in the area of voter mobilization research, the study causal moderation through matching, and the combination of matching and experimentation to treatment self-selection problems.
