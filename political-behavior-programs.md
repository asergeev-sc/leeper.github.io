# A Rough Guide to Doctoral Programs in Political Behavior

Inspired by [the Conflict Consortium's](http://www.conflictconsortium.com/) [Guide to Conflict, Violence, and Peace programs](http://conflictconsortium.weebly.com/annual-review-of-conflict-peace-and-violence-programs-in-political-science.html), I thought it may be useful to compile some information on academic departments providing supervision, methodological training, and infrastructure sufficient to strongly support doctoral specialization. This page attempts to provides that.

Because political behavior is not one of the traditional five fields of (American-style) political science, it can be difficult to identify programs that are likely to support research in the field. This is especially true given that behavior researchers tend to cluster in American Politics subfields at US institutions but in Comparative Politics subfields outside the US.

There is no effort here to indicate whether these programs are "a good choice" according to any other metrics than those listed (e.g., PhD research funding, stipends, quality of life, cost of living, teaching obligations or training, completion rates, post-graduation employment, etc.). It is particularly difficult to keep information on methodological perspectives and training up-to-date; users should rely on department websites and faculty listings to decide whether adequate and appropriate methodological training is available. 

This is a work in progress. All information is provided without guarantees or warranties.
