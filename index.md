I am a Post-Doctoral Researcher in the [Institut for Statskundskab](http://ps.au.dk/en/) at Aarhus University in Aarhus, Denmark. I received my MA and PhD from the [Department of Political Science](http://www.polisci.northwestern.edu/) at Northwestern University, where I was a graduate fellow at the [Institute for Policy Research](http://www.northwestern.edu/ipr/) and served as founding coordinator of the [Northwestern Political Science Research Lab (PSRL)](http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/~jnd260/lab.html). I previously received my BA from the University of Minnesota &#8211; Twin Cities with a BA *magna cum laude* in Political Science and Global Studies (with an emphasis on European politics and society).

My research on individuals' public opinions primarily focuses on the role of information in politics. I am particularly interested in how mass attitudes reflect an interaction between the broader information environment - including the mass media and political elites - and individual-level attributes - namely citizens' expressed behaviors, psychological traits, prior knowledge and opinions, motivation, and affect. My dissertation focused on incorporating issues of information choice and over-time opinion dynamics into the study of political communication and opinion formation. At Aarhus, I am part of the [POLIS Political Parties and Issue Strategies research group](http://ps.au.dk/en/research/research-centres-and-units/polis/), where I study interactions between political parties and public opinion.

Using both survey and experimental methods, I attempt to study public opinion and political behavior from the perspectives of social and cognitive psychology, mass communication, and democratic theory. In addition to my substantive research interests, I am currently engaged in ongoing methodological projects related to nonrandom treatment assignment, internet-based experimentation, sample-related validity concerns, and interaction effects in observational studies.

I also actively develop an array of software for the R programming environment and participate in the [rOpenSci](http://ropensci.org/) and [rOpenGov](http://ropengov.github.io/) development projects, which aim to easily integrate science- and government-related data and applications into R.
